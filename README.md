# ITU-projekt---StreamingService
ITU programmering projekt

This program reads files from the data folder and shows the data in a GUI window. So please put any data-related folders inside.
Data: filmplakater (folder), serieforsider (folder), film.txt, serier.txt

There may be some issues with the IDE not showing the favorites.txt file after closing the program but the file should still be visable inside the windows explorer directory.

You may be prompted to need to setup your JDK to be java 18 when opening the project and if you can't run the tests it may be because you need to specify a Jupiter path YOU MUST CHOOSE JUPITER 5.x or higher for this to work.

Don't change the streamingIcons path or the images won't show.
